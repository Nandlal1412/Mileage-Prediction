# Mileage-Prediction

## Overview
This project involves developing a Mileage Prediction Model using a series of machine learning techniques and methodologies. The main goal is to predict the mileage of vehicles based on various input features.

## Key Features
### *Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:* 
Removing null values and outliers to ensure data quality.

### *Train-Test Split:*  
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Modeling Approaches:

Linear Regression

Polynomial Regression

## Performance Metrics: 
Evaluating model performance using standard metrics like RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### *Standard Scaling:* 
Applying standard scaling to normalize the feature set.

### *Model Accuracy:* 
Assessing and comparing the accuracy of different models.

## Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn
